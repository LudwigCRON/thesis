Each block has been considered as an IP so far. In this regard, their performances are cross-checked by measurements over the temperature range of operation: from -40$\degree$C to 175$\degree$C.

This chapter presents the four different test chips designed during the thesis. These are listed in the table~\ref{tbl:test-chip-list-and-dates}, and represented in \figurename~\ref{fig:testchips-layout}. The first test chip called DOE\_COMP assesses comparators. There are two versions of it to characterize the fast comparators needed for the two first stages of our ADC, and for the slow version of them used in the last stage of our ADC. The second test chip evaluates the converter last stage (SAR), and the comparator in its environment. Called DOE\_SAR, its goal is the measurement of the static performances of the SAR ADC\@. Then, DOE\_ADC is the final test chip to evaluate both the static and the dynamic performance of the ADC, all stages combined.

The inner chip temperature measurement is therefore crucial for the comparison between simulation results and measures. Being a common component inside every test chips, for the sake of clarity, the chapter begins with its description.
%After a brief review of common technique to validate an ADC, their application for the unusual SAR operation is presented. Finally, ongoing validation plan of the ADC is bestowed.

\section{Internal Temperature Measurement (for all test chips)}
Due to the heat dissipation from the silicon to the ambient air, and the self-heating of components, the temperature inside the chip will be greater than the ambient temperature. In order to compare measurement with the simulation results, the temperature inside the chip should be measured.

As presented in section~\ref{sec:bandgap} in the \figurename~\ref{fig:bandgap}, the band-gap energy of the silicon decreases with the temperature. As the Fermi energy being a fraction of the band-gap energy, the temperature affects the Fermi energy as well with an almost similar variation. Based on the latter, the threshold voltage tracks the variation coming from the band-gap energy due to the temperature. In consequence, the simplest temperature tracker is a diode whose threshold voltage varies in accordance with these explanations.

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Chapter5/Figs/temp_test/temperature_sensor_configuration.ps}
    \caption{Two possible configurations based on a single PNP\@: brokaw band-gap or diode mode to sense the internal temperature}
    \label{fig:temp_sensor_bipolar}
\end{figure}

The temperature measurement circuit consists in measuring the voltage across a diode with a constant forward current as depicted in \figurename~\ref{fig:temp_sensor_bipolar}. With a bipolar transistor in diode mode, the voltage across the emitter and the collector follows the Shockley-diode equation and is almost linear with the temperature as in equation~(\ref{eq:diode_temp}).
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:diode_temp}
    V(T) = n \frac{k_BT}{q}\ln\left(\frac{I_b}{I_s}+1 \right)
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of diodes in parallel, $I_b$ the forward biasing current, and $I_s$ the specific current of the diode.

In practice the biasing current can be either a bench top source meter or a simple resistor. For the sake of simplicity, a resistor has been selected. For a power supply of 1.8 V, simulation performed demonstrates good results for a biasing resistance $R = 33 k\Omega$. Represented in \figurename~\ref{fig:vdiode}, the diode voltage variation is between 220 mV and 350 mV across process corners for a temperature from -40\(\degree\)C to 175\(\degree\)C. The resolution achieved is about less than 1 mK/mV. And \figurename~\ref{fig:diode_sens_temp} represents the non linearity of the solution with a resistor. If the differential measurement is preferred one could connect into the Browkaw configuration. Nevertheless, the differential value is highly nonlinear and drops from 16 mV to almost 0 at high temperature. The latter is not selected for our test for its lower resolution.

As the specific current and the current injected to forward bias the diode depend on the process and the temperature, and due to the non-linearity of the bandgap energy, a calibration should be performed before any other test. The voltage would be measured in a controlled temperature environment by steps of 5\(\degree\)C in the temperature range. This operation serves to calibrate the measure and to create a calibration table for the chip tested. For each sample of the chip, a calibration table has to be associated.

    \label{fig:vdiode_sim}
\end{figure}

A parametric analysis varying the temperature over the range in 15 points gives the results presented in the \figurename~\ref{fig:vdiode_sim}. The \figurename~\ref{fig:vdiode} represents the variation of the voltage across the diode with the temperature. The voltage variation is 380 mV with a value of 730 mV instead of 732 mV in theory at 27\(\degree\)C. This confirms the sizing of the design. The plot of the \figurename~\ref{fig:diode_sens_temp} represents the sensitivity of the voltage across the temperature range. As expected the sensitivity is about -1.7 mV/\(\degree\)C with a variation that is not linear with the temperature. The choice for a calibration table, instead of an approximate linear transformation to calculate the temperature, is based on the desired accuracy for the application intended. Indeed, with a least square approximation of the linear transform the maximum error would be 2.4 mV or 1.4\(\degree\)C due to the curvature.

\section{Full ADC validation}
Towards a future evaluation of the ADC, this test chip is the last in the thesis and has not been tested yet. Nevertheless, this test chip has the ambition to assess each sub-ADC and the complete ADC at full speed. In this regard, the conception and preliminary simulation results are discussed. After the thesis, it is planned I finish the ADC validation.

The on-going chip design is represented in \figurename~\ref{fig:top-chip}. There are two ADC analog parts. One is designed for sub-ADC test whereas the second is designed to evaluate the ADC in itself. The one designed for sub-ADC characterization is also designed for evaluation of itself as a complete ADC built of these sub-ADCs. In the analog domain, there are two analog buffers for the inspection of analog signal, to wit, the residue of the each stage. Between the analog cores, the digital drives them and generates non-overlapping clock phases needed to control switches in the analog. Moreover, the digital block contains a configuration link to define what is under evaluation and how the buffers should be interconnected to the ADC\@. Finally, an ADC is sensitive to clock jitter and duty-cycle. To minimize this, an LVDS clock receiver has been designed for the ADC\@.

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Chapter5/Figs/adc_chip/top_adc_chip.ps}%TOP-CHIP.png}
    \caption{On-going test chip schematic of two ADC analog parts within along the common digital block with an LVDS clock recovery and analog buffers}
    \label{fig:top-chip}
\end{figure}

The evaluation is planned to follow the validation plan discussed in Section~\ref{sec:validation}. In addition to this, the temperature and the power consumption are background measurements to get truth worthy values under experimental conditions to later consider them in the power management of future projects.

\subsection{Power Consumption}
In order to measure the power consumption of each stage, there is a single power supply pad for the analogue and one single power supply pad for the digital for each stage. In total, there are 6 power supplies pads for the ADC\@. Of course, to each power supply a ground is dedicated on the chip leading to the following supply voltages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item VDDA1V8<3:1>
    \item GNDA1V8<3:1>
    \item VDD1V8<3:1>
    \item GND1V8<3:1>
\end{itemize}
The number inside bracket corresponds to a single voltage reference associated with the stage that this number reference: VDDA1V8<1> is connected to the ADC with stage under test selections, while VDDA1V8<2> is connected to the ADC without selections, and VDDA1V8<3> to the LVDS circuit for the clock. The order is kept for the digital power supply voltage VDD1V8 and the ground as well.
Even if they are connected together on the PCB, the connection will be on a ground plane for the analogue and another one for the digital. At least, the digital and the analogue can share the same ground plane if there is a slit to reduce the switching noise of the digital on the analogue ground.
Concerning the analogue buffer to replicate the residue voltage, they operate at 3.5 V provided by an analogue power supply.

In simulation, the average power consumption of the first stage is 3.7 mW, the second stage is 3.9 mW, and of the last stage is 0.8 mW. The measurement can be realized with a Keithley-2000 series appropriate in the sub micro-amps range accuracy up to 3 A. One should pay a particular attention to the digital pad connected to the digital power supply which increases the power consumption of the digital part. For the analogue part, the maximum power consumption is expected to be less than 16 mW.

\subsection{Sub-ADC validation}
While the ADC validation plan given in Appendix~\ref{sec:validation} has the purpose of performance characterization, the Sub-ADC validation does not serve the same purpose. The Sub-ADC validation allows the detection of analogue limitation over temperature. In this regard, each stage shall be tested independently from the other.

According to the validation plan, Sub-ADCs undergo a static and a dynamic evaluation. Unfortunately, the independence does not hold for dynamic evaluation as the error committed between two consecutive stages and the stage under test followed by an external ADC will not exhibit the same transient responses. In consequence, for dynamic characterization the stage under test and the stage following it are always on.

    \subsubsection{Input Voltage Selection}
The evaluation of the Sub-ADC consists in injecting the input voltage to be tested (ramp/sinusoid) at the input of the sub-ADC under test. The input selection is controlled by the configuration link which in turn drives an analog multiplexer. In the design of the analog multiplexer, we consider two factors: first the settling error of the RC filtering made of the capacitive load after the MUX and the pass resistance of the MUX, and the extra capacitive load it represents on the amplifier of the previous stage. The latter is a criterion to be able to use this analog part as a degraded ADC IP or has an ADC IP prepared for built-in test possibility. As depicted by \figurename~\ref{fig:adc-with-test}, the analog multiplexers are in the signal path of the input voltage and of the residue.

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Chapter5/Figs/adc_chip/adc-with-test-signal-path.png}
    \caption{Analog core of the ADC IP with input selection for sub-ADC assessment}
    \label{fig:adc-with-test}
\end{figure}

Even if the analog residue is planned to be between 0.65 V and 1.15 V for a differential $\pm V_{ref}/2$, we should not neglect the mismatch engendering offsets. So, the switches are CMOS to allow an extended input voltage range without adding extra errors due to a limited excursion of transistors.

Concerning the settling time, the maximum capacitive load an analog multiplexer is the capacitive load the SAR DAC represents. With its 950 fF in typical case and 1 pF as an edge case, we expect a settling not exceeding 40\% of the clock period to allow a large duty cycle variation. To reach an accuracy of 14-bits, the time allotted for the settling is assessed to be at minimum 9.5 times the time constant of the approximated first order RC-filter. The allotted settling time being 40\% of the clock period, we deduce a time constant of 421 ps. In turn, the maximum on-resistance of the analog multiplexer is 607$\Omega$ whatsoever the PVT condition is. To ensure this, the low-vth nmos transistors have a W/L = 4$\mu m$/0.18$\mu m$ and pmos transistors are 3 times bigger.

In addition to that, the parasitic capacitance of the CMOS switches injects charges on the input capacitance of the sub-ADC under test as well. The minimum input capacitance is the combination of the sampling and feedback capacitors of the algorithmic stage with 200 fF. Based on simulations in the worst corner for the parasitic capacitance of the MOS transistors, the charge injection coming from nmos transistors is estimated to be few nanovolts as there are completely absorbed by the pmos parasitic capacitance. While the charge injection coming from the pmos transistors is estimated to reach 8 mV in the worst case.

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Chapter5/Figs/adc_chip/amux21-parasitic-ws-6s.png}
    \caption{The parasitic capacitance of the input of the analog multiplexer the process corner exhibiting the maximum of the parasitic capacitance for several temperatures from -45$\degree$C to 175$\degree$C for an input voltage from 0 to 2 V}
    \label{fig:adc-with-test}
\end{figure}

Henceforth, the input capacitor of sub-ADC should have a long sampling time to recover from the charge injection. That is why, as the configuration is received the analog multiplexer are connected accordingly and the test is at least 50 ns latter.

    \subsubsection{Static Error Estimation}
The goal of this test is to determine the error committed by the ADC stage under test without considering the limitation of the settling time. The applied input stimulus applied will be a staircase from -0.5 V to + 0.5 V differentially around 0.9 V for a power supply of 1.8 V. A step represents the accuracy with which the code level transition is extracted. In order to measure the worst case the ADC could encounter, the precision should be of the resolution of the ADC at this stage: less than 1.9 mV.

The principle of this test consists in performing a conversion for each step by sending a pulse on the start signal lasting no more than 4 clock cycles, \figurename~\ref{fig:adc-static-test}. For a 100 MHz clock, this corresponds to a pulse width of 40 ns. As a consequence, at the end of the conversion, the voltage of the residue is kept and the analog 3.5 V buffers connected on the residue voltages replicate them on a bigger load that represents the analogue pad, the parasitic on the PCB and the probe for the measurement. Once the measurement done, another pulse on the start signal will perform another conversion.

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Chapter5/Figs/adc_chip/static-test-principle.ps}
    \caption{Principle of the static error estimation test with a measurement of the analogue residue}
    \label{fig:adc-static-test}
\end{figure}

Concerning the impact of the input capacitance of the buffer, transmission gates isolate them while a transistor connects their input voltages to the ground. Then, the transistors connecting to the ground are released while the transmission gates connect the residue to the input of buffers, as depicted by the \figurename~\ref{fig:adc-static-test-buffers-clocking}. From a digital point of view, the digital circuit driving switches in the analog core of the ADC is halted when the new\_sample signal is enabled and we are in the static test mode. So then, the buffers replicate the residue voltage stored by either the integration capacitor of the I\(\Delta \Sigma\), or one of the sampling capacitor of the Algorithmic.

To estimate the static error of the sub-ADC under test, the input voltage estimated is subtracted from the voltage reconstitution done and the added value of the residue. The linearity of the curve would indicate a reduced linearity range of the amplifier. And the maximum error in this linearity range would give the effective gain of the amplifier.

\begin{figure}[htp]

    \caption{Principle of the static error estimation test with a measurement of the analogue residue}
    \label{fig:adc-static-test-buffers-clocking}
\end{figure}

Concerning the impact of the input capacitance of the buffer, transmission gates isolate them while a transistor connects their input voltages to the ground. Then, the transistors connecting to the ground are released while the transmission gates connect the residue to the input of buffers, as depicted by the \figurename~\ref{fig:adc-static-test-buffers-clocking}.

To estimate the error, the voltage reconstitution should be done by affecting a weight for each bit of 1/OSR and by adding the value of the residue. By subtracting this voltage to the input voltage applied at the input the static error is given as a function of the input voltage. The linearity of the curve would indicate a reduced linearity range of the amplifier. And the maximum error in this linearity range would give the effective gain of the amplifier.

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Chapter5/Figs/adc_chip/sd_integrator_leakage.ps}
    \caption{Leakage current limiting the holding time of the residue for the measure}
    \label{fig:adc-static-test-leakage}
\end{figure}

One precaution, in this test holds in the design of switches to reset the amplifier and the integrator. As depicted in the \figurename~\ref{fig:adc-static-test-leakage}, for a differential residue voltage, a non-ideal off-resistance of the reset switches lead a leakage current discharging the integration capacitor. The load capacitor of the residue being at least 200 fF, the maximum leakage current allowed for 1 LSB drop after 20 $\mu$s is 2.44 pA. This is equivalent to say, that the leakage impedance is 100 G$\Omega$. Over temperature, the criterion cannot be ensured but only limited. Considering the settling time of the reset, the best comprise is Wn=Wp=2 $\mu$m and Ln=Lp=0.18 $\mu$m for the switches of the reset.
By the way, the analogue residue measure should be done once during the conversion to estimate the offset of the buffers, and once the conversion is done the fastest possible. Either a precise ADC of 14-bits giving the results in less than 5 us or a high-precision voltmeter is necessary.

    \subsubsection{Dynamic Error Estimation}
The goal of this test is to give the impact of time slots for the settling and to determine the error caused by a slow amplifier. In order to shrink the test time, The input stimulus applied will be a differential staircase ramp from -1 V to +1V around 0.9 V for a power supply of 1.8 V. A step represents the accuracy with which the code level transition is extracted. In order to measure the worst case the ADC could encounter, the precision should be of the resolution of the ADC: less than 488 $\mu$V in 5 clock cycle mode while the steps are set to 122 $\mu$V in 6 clock cycle mode.

To estimate the residue of the first stage, the I\(\Delta \Sigma\) should operate as a standard \(\Delta \Sigma\) modulator running over 4101 clock cycle (4102 if cycle6 = 1). The signal start shall be kept to 1 for all the duration of the residue estimation: 5 clock cycles to generate the residue, and 4096 clock cycles to reach a 12-bit resolution on the residue. So, the signal start is hold to 1 for 4101 clock cycles. From a digital point of view, the reset switch is disabled and the output bits are still output every 5 clock cycles (6 if cycle6 = 1). These output codes are read on the rising edge of the clock CLK\_RESULT\@. These shall be stored either in a FIFO of the test device reading and configuring the test setup of the motherboard, and then in a file for post-processing. For each voltage in the test, 821 output codes are concatenated and bits are summed.

To estimate the residue of the second stage, the Algorithmic re-samples its last clock cycle residue such that it operates as an algorithmic with an oversampling ratio of respectively 10 or 12 clock cycles according to the sign of the cycle6 signal. Then, the residue at the end of the tenth/twelves clock cycle is passed to the SAR\@. The final resolution of the residue estimation is thus 9-bits in 5 clock cycles and 11-bits in the 6 clock cycle mode. In the digital, only one every other sample start with the loading state. And from an estimation point of view, only the second output code of the algorithmic and the related output code of the SAR are of interest.

\subsection{Test Configuration}
This test chip contains two ADCs: one with each stage independently testable and one with internally connected stages to produce a full ADC\@. The target of this chip is to implement the modification on the ADC only version to test each stage independently. Since performances can be altered, a second ADC without the modification is placed alongside.

The test configuration is sent on CFG\_RX with the clock CFG\_CLK alongside in the order depicted by \figurename~\ref{fig:adc-test-config-link}. Built around a shift register, the bits sent on the RX line are also output on the TX line. So, these can be checked for debug purpose. To store the configuration word, a single pulse on the CFG\_VALID is sent with the last bit. To ensure the chip has been correctly set-up, we increase the duration of the validation pulse to be at least two clock cycles. In this case, the values stored in the configuration register are copied back into the shift register. To be more precise, the rewrite of the shift register occurs when CFG\_VALID fall down. Therefore, the CFG\_VALID pulse can be long, the data sent back are correct. Whatever is sent on CFG\_TX when CFG\_VALID is 1 is disregarded.

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Chapter5/Figs/adc_chip/ADC_CFG_SPI.ps}
    \caption{Configuration bits order for the selection of the test and configuration of possible existing mode of the ADC}
    \label{fig:adc-test-config-link}
\end{figure}

Among the 13-bits configuration register, the first bit ADCT\_ADC selects which ADC analog core is under test. Set High, the ADC with sub-ADC input selection is under test while set Low, the ADC without input selection is under test.

Bits called CHARAC<1:0> select which part is under test if ADCT\_ADC is Low:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 00: Sigma-Delta Incremental
    \item 01: Algorithmic
    \item 10: SAR
    \item 11: Full ADC
\end{itemize}

The bits BUFRES<1:0> select which residue is connected to the buffers for measurements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 00: None
    \item 01: Algorithmic
    \item 10: I\(\Delta \Sigma\)
    \item 11: Shall never be used
\end{itemize}

Finally, a synchronizer block is in charge of triggering the start of a new sample for the all three stages based on the following bits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item START: when conversion is expected to be performed/when a conversion should start
    \item CYCLE6: the ADC performs a conversion in 6 clock cycle or in 5
    \item DYNTEST: the rising edge of the signal start starts a new conversion. While start is 1 each stage is still processing.
\end{itemize}

\section{Preliminary ADC Schematic Simulation Results}
In this section we present preliminary simulation results of the analog core of the ADC\@. The simulations performed are full transistor for the analog core and for the interface between the digital and the analog. Comparators and OTAs are those designed in the chapter~\ref{sec:analog-building-bloc} at the schematic level.

The DOE\_ADC chip is composed of the schematic presented earlier in \figurename~\ref{fig:top-chip} with addition pads from the PDK of the technology. In order to estimate the future behavior of the ADC, we model the wire bonding by an RL-serie circuit with R=0.1 $\Omega$, and L=1 nH. This corresponds to a wire whose diameter is 55 $\mu$m and 1 cm long.
As depicted by \figurename~\ref{fig:tb_adc-top}, all signals and power supplies are connected by the wire bondings model to the chip. A verilog bloc sends the test configuration to DOE\_ADC\@. For instance, to test only the ADC in 6 clock cycle mode the pattern sent is 1000010010100. While for the ADC with an OSR = 5, we send 1000000010100. In addition to that, a verilog-ams bloc stores in a file the output codes and the voltages $V_{\rm inp}/V_{\rm inm}$. These permit the evaluation of the ADC (DNL, INL, SNR, ENOB, ...).

By default, the input voltage is a linear ramp, changing at a rate of $1/F_s$ by a fifth of the LSB\@. The differential input voltage ramps up from -1 V to + 1 V.

% clock generation
Concerning the clock generation, the LVDS signal is made from an ideal pulsed source with a transition time of 3 ns between a low-level of 0.7 V to a high-level of 1.1 V. With a differential amplitude of 400 mV around a common-mode of 0.9 V, the LVDS clock signal is a best-case.

% post-processing
To extract the information on the resolution, we reconstruct the input signal from the output bit of the ADC by their ideal weight. In this case the weight is the voltage contribution of each bit. For the first stage, each bit has an ideal weight of 1/OSR. For the second stage, the ideal weight is [0.5 0.25 0.125 0.0625]/OSR. And the contribution of the SAR is given by the equation~(\ref{eqn:output_voltage_dac_sar}) scaled by a factor 0.0625/OSR\@. The offset has been estimated by averaging the output code and is removed in the transfer function.

\figurename~\ref{fig:adc-res-schematic-temp-tt} presents the resolution based on the maximum error between the resolution input voltage and its reconstruction from the output codes. After an offset estimation based on the average output code, the maximum resolution is represented for an oversampling ratio of 5 and 6 in the typical process corner.

The ADC exhibits an encouraging stable behavior over temperature. The error committed on the residue of the first stage has the deepest impact on the final resolution. Heavily relying on the performance of the OTA, and a gain higher than the 11.2-bits of resolution, the ADC in 5 clock cycle mode does not suffer from the temperature. To the contrary, in the 6 clock cycle mode, the OTA gain in a typical corner drops from 86 dB to 78 dB. In consequence, the best case error of the OTA on the residue drops from a 14-bits resolution to a 13.3-bits one. Therefore, the resolution also drops from 100$\degree$C. The error committed on the first stage residue being less than an LSB of the sub-ADCs remaining, the ADC does experience a more severe degradation of its resolution.

With the process variation, the OTA undergoes a severe degradation of its gain and its settling speed. This OTA degradation has repercussions on the resolution of the ADC. The results of the resolution due to the process variation are depicted by \figurename~\ref{fig:adc-res-schematic-temp-corners} for the ADC operating at 6 clock cycles per sample.

    \caption{Resolution over the temperature for each corner of the process with the ADC operating at 6 clock cycles per sample}
    \label{fig:adc-res-schematic-temp-corners}
\end{figure}

The results over the corners of the process display a drop of 0.67-bits. This drop is a third of experimentation in the work of Ericson over the same temperature range with a 0.5$\mu$m SOS-CMOS technology~\cite{Ericson2004}. It is planned to validate the behavior in simulation with coming experimental data.

At this stage of the realization, the analogue part of the ADC consumes 9 mW in the worst case. With a Nyquist frequency of 8.33 MHz for a resolution of 13-bits in 6 clock cycle mode, the corresponding Walden Figure of Merit is 131 fJ/conv for an area of 0.12 $\rm mm^2$. Similarly, in 5 clock cycle mode, the Walden FoM is given to be 382 fJ/conv for a target of 390 fJ/conv. The design is in the middle of publications in ISSCC and VLSI as depicted by \figurename~\ref{fig:walden-fom-comparison-designed}.

\end{figure}

In order to represent the effort of integration, \figurename~\ref{fig:walden-area-fom-comparison-designed} represents the FoM versus the area of one channel for ADC realized in 180 nm technology. The proposed converter exhibits a low area footprint, placing it at the front edge of the technology. Considering the FoM, the results can be improved by either reducing the power consumption, or by increasing the resolution.

In this work, a low-OSR 3-stage hybrid ADC is employed to improve the sampling rate, and the resolution without sacrificing the silicon area. This work also proposed a temperature aware design of the building blocks to reduce the performance drop with increasing temperature. After design, the performance achieved are listed in Table~\ref{tbl:adc-spec-comp}.
