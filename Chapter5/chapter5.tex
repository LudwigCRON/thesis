\section{Objectives}
The Chapter~\ref{sec:adc-implementation} presents the operation of the proposed ADC architecture and the modification to proffer enhanced reliability and reduce constraints on the analog core. The constraints relaxed add the possibility to use existing analog blocs just created in Chapter~\ref{sec:analog-building-bloc}. Henceforth, these blocs shall be validated experimentally.

The ADC test chip being under verification after layout, the proposed ADC have not been tested yet. Nevertheless, previous samples have been tape out and tested in order to validate comparators IP bloc and the last stage of the ADC mixing pseudo-synchronous digital and extracting most of the bits.

This chapter discuss methods and consideration for the test of these tape-out samples as well as the measurement results of an original method to extract the delay of clocked comparators.

\section{Packaging}           % section 5.1
% explain the choice for testing as many samples are able to be tested --> daughter-board and mother-board
% possibility to have commercial component on a motherboard

% thermal stream

% temperature effect boards are suffering from (db and mb)
The temperature affects the printed circuit board in several manner which are decomposed into material intrinsic properties alteration and material-material interfaces phenomena. For tests and measurements, we should consider both the mechanical and the electrical properties of the IC and the of the test boards.

\subsection{IC packaging}
The package of an integrated circuit is an interface to the environment surrounding the chip whose desirable properties are a low thermal resistance to prevent the heat to be trap inside the package degrading ever more the Silicon electrical performance. As presented in Section~\ref{sec:carrier_density} \figurename~\ref{fig:electron_density}, the target design is close to the operating region where the carrier density is getting as sparse as within an intrinsic silicon bloc.
Therefore, the heat should be evacuated as quickly as possible while the selected package is as close as possible to the final one for relevant measurements. In addition to that, test under high temperature gives enough energy for most redox chemical reactions in which oxidations of contact and metals are expected to occurs.

Exposed to the environment, the package is thus selected based on its thermal-resistance to dissipate heat, its electrical insulation, and its protection from oxidation among many.

In order to output high frequencies signal for debug purpose, parasitic are intended to be minimized. This consider both the wire-bonding and the pins.

For the sake of simplicity, Table~\ref{tbl:high-temp-package} compares the properties of traditional package (plastic and ceramic) with fully closed encapsulation. Indeed, as large area of METTP is not allowed by the process manufacturing to prevent antenna effect, large area of metal have slits exposing the silicon based dielectric to the light. Partially closed or open IC allows visual verification of wire-bonding at the cost of substrate ionisation by the absorption of light being more likely as the temperature increase (\(E_g\) is decreasing and a band gap shift occurs with the temperature~\cite{Lautenschlager1985,Klenner1992} while the fermi-dirac distribution becomes wider).

For high temperature integrated circuits, the most physically robust solution is a ceramic package with a caution on the dielectric constant value which is have a large discrepancy with most PCB material. Therefore, the plastic package is thus the most appropriate for test temperature below 160\(\degree C\). Willing to test the IC at 175\(\degree C\), and a chip size of 1.3 mm x 1.3 mm while a CLCC68 package would be of 25.4 mm x 25.4 mm the inductance of a wire connected at a corner would be of 26 nH. a Glob Top solution is good compromise which allows a chip-on-board connection limiting the inductance to 7 nH.

Considering discrete buffers whose pin's capacitance are 20 pF, the capacitance of the PCB trace of 7 pF and a pad capacitance of the IC of 1.9 pF, the cut-off frequency is boosted from 180 MHz to 353 MHz in the worst case. From another point of view the sampling frequency of ADC being 20 MHz, the settling have 9 to 17 times the time constant of the line.

One precaution that have been overlooked in the design but have a deep impact on results is a protection for the Glob Top to reduce the sensitivity to air pressure variation. In order to use commercial on-the-shelves components on a motherboard, the test over temperature are performed with a thermal stream 5000 from MPI\@. The hot air is blown on the area delimited by its thermal enclosure. The temperature increasing the glob top tends to be malleable and the air pressure on the wire bonding. To limit the impact a cover have been placed over the daughter-board to let the air surrounding the IC heating but preventing a direct blown air on the IC as depicted by \figurename~\ref{fig:thermalstream-air-protection}.

    \label{fig:thermalstream-air-protection}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Boards}
With regards to the PCB conception, the temperature increasing inflates the dielectric. The distance between metal layers changing, the dielectric constant is thus temperature dependant (at least from a geometrical point of view). Changes in z-axis CTE and dielectric constant as a function of temperature can significantly impact the impedance of strip transmission lines fabricated on that material while engendering a mechanical stress on soldering points and vias.

Because a material can undergo such a drastic change in CTE, it becomes mechanically and electrically unstable when operating above a defined temperature Tg, when the dielectric become soft and malleable. The PCB should always be maintained below that temperature except for short-duration processing steps, such as solder reflow.

% special case of the mother board
In the special of the motherboard, more precisely at connections points with the daughter-board, pins from one connector are soldered to transmission lines. The pins connectors and transmission lines being in copper while the soldering is a dissimilar metal, an electromotive force appear at the junction coming from a thermal difference between each metal. Also called Seebeck effect, for a Copper-Lead-Tin Solder the coefficient of the electromotive force is 5 \(\mu V/\degree C \) which sufficient to generate an error of 500 \(\mu V\) for 100 \(\degree C\) between the two.

In order to perform the characterisation of the ADC whose accuracy reach 12-bits with an input excursion of \(\pm \) 1 V, the thermal difference shall not be higher than 24\(\degree C\). One way to cope with this effect is by waiting the establishment of the temperature before a characterisation at a new temperature. In addition for sensitive nodes, differential signalling is recommended.

Even if differential signalling is done, a high speed signal over long trace is prone to power reflection. Impedance matching is consider in the design of the trace for both analog and digital signals from 25 MHz to 100 MHz. A solution based on motherboard for signal generation and reshaping and a daughter-board with only the test chips under temperature is the most effective way to achieve the matching with test devices.

% buffers for digital to reduce large current from the ADC parts generating higher noise
On transmission lines for high speed digital, bidirectional buffers are added to keep the signal end-to-end clean. Digital buffers benefits are three fold: First, they adapt the signal from a 1.8 V voltage domain to a more traditional 3.3 V to 5 V of digital test device (LVDS IP usually consider a 3.3 V voltage domain). Second, splitting the signal path into several chunk, the impedance matching is easier to realize between the IC and the buffers. And as the digital lines of test devices have an impedance of 150 \(\Omega \) to 300 \(\Omega \), the matching not being perfect from the test devices to the buffers will only have low-reflection capacitance. During the conception the maximum allowed power reflected is 10 \% which correspond to a maximum VSWR (voltage standing wave ratio) equal to 1.22 which is in nutshell an error due to mismatch of 30 \(\Omega \). Third without them, the digital pads of the IC should provide a large current to charge and pump the capacitance of test devices. The large transient current generate a large noise whose decoupling from the analog core is more difficult. By the addition of buffers, the capacitive load is reduced and the generated noise is decreased.

% capacitors and decoupling
To enhance the performance, it is critical to place the reservoir capacitor close to the ADC’s sensitive inputs. Among the most sensitive ones are reference input pins, input voltages, and power supplies. While the input pins are high speed signals, the impedance matching is suppose to be sufficient. For practical reason small capacitors are needed to filter out possible coupling noise. 

But for DC signals such references and power supplies, the filtering network depends on the load and the current profile. For instance, on the SAR sub-ADC the power supply shall be feed large transient current the comparator while the reference drops only while the reference is connected to the DAC\@. The capacitor acts as a charge reservoir with charge pumped by the load and re-filled at a rate depending from the resistivity of the path for re-filling, \figurename~\ref{fig:decoupling-strategy}. To decrease the minimum time to recover, decoupling capacitor have been split into one inside the IC chip and several outside. To prevent oscillations the ESR of decoupling capacitors is minimized by using multiple vias to a ground plane and using wide traces to connect them. Ceramic capacitors with X7R dielectric are a good choice close to IC where the temperature is the highest (175 \(\degree C\)). Then outside at ambient temperature a large 470 \(\mu F\) electrolytic capacitor filter the voltage provided by the power supply source, an Hameg HMP 4040.

\section{Comparators Validation}
Let's us consider now the validation of the simplest analog: the clocked comparator found in each stage of our proposed ADC\@. This key elements have been designed under the stringent constraint of the propagation delay for which process fluctuation exacerbates the need of validation. From an junction temperature of -40\(\degree \)C to +175\(\degree \)C, the experimental measurements of the propagation delay pose an interesting challenge. Earlier works have used simple as well as complex circuits for delay extraction. 

The easiest solution would be to externalize the clock and the outputs of the comparator to extract the delay by a high speed high resolution measurement device. Unfortunately, outputs drivers consumes much chip area, add extra delay, bond-wires inductances would alter the signal and the delay estimation too, and different length of cables between the clock of reference and the output generates unconditional error prone measurement system.

For a simple solution of delay measurement, one can generates a DC voltage proportional to the delay. In the case of a clocked comparator, continuous decisions made are averaged by a low-pass filter to externalize a DC voltage. Difficulties occurs as a pulse indicates a ``decision made'' event whose width is sensitive to the parasitics and PVT variations. While the PVT variations can be alleviated by the employ of mathematical expressions for differential output pulses as in~\cite{1706643}, it suffers of mismatch in parasitics seen by XOR cells within the pulse of reference generator and the generator of the ``decision made'' pulse.

% figure of practical implementations

For instance, high precision time interval measurements systems are commonly used in Telecommunications, nuclear science, frequency synthesis, measurement devices such as oscilloscopes and logic analysers, and time-of-flight cameras are heavily rely on time-to-digital converters (TDC). In a nutshell, TDC are made with a counter and delay line interpolation~\cite{1637593}. Such converters have a limited achievable accuracy in a technology based on the small delay cell (an inverter), the quantization noise, and the non-linearity in the time interpolation. The latter coming from variation in the delay elements of the smallest delay cell, as the cascade of delay cells increase, the integral non-linearity grows such that accurate measurement of large delay is challenging.

In contrast, measurement circuits based on Vernier delay line can achieve fine delay resolution.

    \caption{Some delay line implementation for the delay estimation and practical implementations of delay cells}
    \label{fig:delay_vernier_interpolation}
\end{figure}

Practical implementations of the delay line and interpolation is depicted by \figurename~\ref{fig:delay_vernier_interpolation}. J.P. Jansson \textit{et al.} use the differential implementation represented in this figure. To estimate the delay a synchronous counter performs a coarse estimation of the delay while the recorded state of the delay line divides the clock of the counter into pieces of \(\Delta T\)~\cite{1637593}. The recorded state of the delay line correspond to the value stored by DFFs of the positive output of these delay cells.

That said, averaging results either in the time domain or by several TDC running in parallel mitigates the non-linearity: the improvements being inversely proportional to the square root of measurements. However they are sensitive to PVT variations~\cite{6233014, 5256168} such that calibration is mandatory. Finally, this method does not timely occupy a silicon footprint for built-in self-test.

Finally, the ring oscillator can also be employed to estimated the delay as in~\cite{8267856} wherein perused different oscillators related to the device under test can accurately calculate the delay of element under test. In the case of~\cite{8267856} the delay of Through-Silicon Via for 3D IC are measured. This solution fit within a small silicon area with large measurement range, Unfortunately, as the number of oscillators increase mismatches of their instance are averaged and the calculus of the delay becomes even more tedious. Furthermore, it is difficult from the design phase to estimate the accuracy of measurement.

Therefore, we proposed a circuit to reliably measure the comparator's delay with a differential measure of frequency generated by an auto-oscillator with a estimation of the measurement accuracy early in its design phase. The generated frequency is then divided by an arbitrary ratio N to be measured to prevent high speed signal routing consideration.

The auto-oscillator generates first a frequency of reference without the comparator only based on digital cells. Then, with the same digital cells configuration the frequency is generated by fully restored comparator's outputs in response to the comparators input voltages when the frequency trigger the comparator.

\end{figure}

\figurename~\ref{fig:meas_circ_schem} represents the auto-oscillator circuit connected to the comparator under test. Build around a central D-Flip-Flop generating our frequency CLKCMP, an inverter is used to generate the complementary clock with some delay (\(\approx\)70 ps) to test the Double-Tail comparator.

CALIBN signal allows us to choose the generated frequency: the frequency of reference or the frequency with the comparator to extract the delay. As the comparator required some time to reset, the required time to reset can also be extracted. To select whether we need to extract only the delay or the delay and the reset time of the comparator DLY\_ONLY shall respectively be set to `1' and `0'. And the RESET signal set the CLKCMP signal to `0' which in turn reset the comparator under test. To change from the generation of one frequency to another, a reset is necessary.

At the moment when the signal RESET is released, the reset signal of the DFF is disengage and CLKCMP keep its state. Few picoseconds later, the clock signal of the DFF rise to '1'. This edge triggers the DFF which set its outputs Q to '1', as depicted by the \figurename~\ref{fig:meas_circ_trans} a and b. In consequence, the comparator makes a decision. The DFF is triggered either by the nor of p and m signal if CALIBN is '1' or by the inversion of CLKCMP if CALIBN is '0'. The DFF is reset, and the oscillations begin.

For DLY\_ONLY set to '1', the clock of the DFF (set\_dff) is a delayed \(\overline{CLKCMP}\). Therefore, the time of CLKCMP spend at zero is fixed and PVT dependant. While, for a DLY\_ONLY signal set to '0', the signal set\_dff depends from the generated pulse of the nor gate. In that case, the time that CLKCMP spent at zero is defined by the speed of the comparator to reset.

The frequency difference between the two modes defined by CALIBN corresponds to the mismatch of the MUX inputs selecting either CMPM or CLKCMP, and the delay of the comparator to make a decision. While, the difference introduced by the two states of DLY\_ONLY corresponds to the difference of the delay and the time to reset the comparator. Thus, the proposed circuit is able to extract the delay of the comparator or the delay and the time to reset the comparator.

To ensure the correct operation, the delay between p/m to set\_dff should be greater than the delay between p/m and rst\_dff. And this over the process and temperature variation which limit the measurement delay range of the circuit.

As the same path is used for the generation of the frequency of reference and the frequency with the comparator under test, the PVT dependence of digital cells is the same in either generation case. Therefore, the differential measurement of the frequency cancel the PVT variations.

The calculation of the frequency in the normal operation mode (CALIBN='1' and DLY\_ONLY=RESET='0') is given by the equation (\ref{eqn:freq_meas_circuit_delay}).

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:freq_meas_circuit_delay}
F_{CLKCMP} = \frac{1}{N} {\left(T_{delay}+T_{set}+T_{rst}+T_{reset}\right)}^{-1}
\end{equation}

where $T_{delay}$ is the delay of the comparator, $T_{reset}$ the time the comparator takes to reset, and $T_{set}$/$T_{rst}$ the time of the digital circuit to react. In detail, $T_{set} = 2 T_{MUX} + T_{NOR} + T_{AND2} + T_{DLY2} + T_{DFF} + T_{BUX2}$ and $T_{rst} = T_{MUX} + T_{DLY} + T_{NOR3} + T_{DFF} + T_{BUX2}$.

In the calibration mode (CALIBN='0' and DLY\_ONLY=RESET='0') the frequency is given by equation (\ref{eqn:freq_calib}).

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:freq_calib}
F_{CLKCMP*} = \frac{1}{N} \left(T_{set}+T_{rst}\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}

The delay and the reset time is thus given by the equation (\ref{eqn:dly_reset_from_freq}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:dly_reset_from_freq}
T_{delay}+T_{reset} = \frac{1}{N} \left( \frac{1}{F_{CLKCMP}} - \frac{1}{F_{CLKCMP*}} \right)
\end{equation}

When the DLY\_ONLY signal is set to '1', the reset time of the comparator no longer matter, and $T_{reset}$ of the equation (\ref{eqn:freq_meas_circuit_delay}) and (\ref{eqn:dly_reset_from_freq}) is 0. 

In this design, both set\_dff and rst\_dff are driven by the same signals: $p$ and $m$. To ensure the stability of the circuit the race condition to respect is defined by the equation (\ref{eqn:stability_dly_only_0}) if DLY\_ONLY='0' 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:stability_dly_only_0}
T_{DLY} + T_{NOR3} + T_{margin}<& T_{NOR2} + T_{MUX2} + T_{AND2} + T_{DLY2}
\end{equation}

and by equation (\ref{eqn:stability_dly_only_1}) if DLY\_ONLY='1'.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:stability_dly_only_1}
T_{MUX} + T_{DLY} & + T_{NOR3} + T_{margin} < T_{INV} + 2T_{DLY} + T_{MUX2} + T_{AND2} + T_{DLY2}
\end{equation}

Then, the proposed delay measurement circuits is compared to existing circuits to measure the delay of analog component. The comparison in Table~\ref{tbl:delay-measurement-comparison} highlight the small footprint of the proposed solution for a resolution in the order of few picoseconds which compete to traditional Time-to-Digital converter (TDC). Moreover, the proposed circuit achieve the best power consumption known. Nevertheless, toggling at very high frequency induces large transient peaks detected up to 1 mA.

\section{SAR test}
The SAR is the stage providing most of the complete ADC resolution. With a digital scheme being pseudo-synchronous, and the two first bits given by the previous stage, the test of this stage over the large temperature range from -40\(\degree \)C to +175\(\degree \)C poses an interesting challenge.

For an ADC, both static and dynamic performances shall be known for practical use case. In our case, we limit the scope of metric to those listed in the Table~\ref{tbl:adc-metric-subset}. As the SAR is only a stage from the ADC, non of these are relevant to estimate the ADC performance. In addition to that, while the generation of an accurate and linear differential input to test a 6-bit ADC is not difficult to achieve, the timely generation of the two first bits given to the SAR is a struggling point. Yet, static metric contains meaningful information on the thermal dependance of the stage which can be related the ADC temperature sensitivity. Despite the gain and offset errors are a good estimator and their dependance to the temperature is a key factor, a more accurate understanding of the temperature dependance come from the analysis of the calibration coefficients' variation over temperature. Their variations allows one to detect which group of capacitors and switches generate the possible failure. That said, the non linearity will indicates and error either in the settling or in the comparator decision if no failure is detected.

\begin{table}[htp]
    \centering
    \caption{Metric of interest for the ADC tests}
    \label{tbl:adc-metric-subset}
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Static Metric} & \textbf{Dynamic Metric} \\ \midrule
        -- Gain Error & -- Single-Tone Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)\\
        -- Offset Error & -- Signal to Noise and Distortion (SINAD)\\
        -- Temperature Drift of Gain and Offset Error & -- Effective Number of Bits (ENOB)\\
        -- Differential Non Linearity (DNL) & -- Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) \\
        -- Integral Non Linearity (INL) & \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In order to calculate the metric, the transfer function of the ADC shall be collected at different temperature. Usual methodology and recommended in the 
IEEE 1241-2010 standard, the transfer function can be estimated either by gathering the output code for many samples across the input range, or by a servo loop finding the input voltage at tge transitions between two output codes. The servo-loop method has not been selected since no transition exist for extreme input voltages value prevent the detection of a transfer function less than 1.

An histogram is collected by driving the analogue inputs of the ADC with a known signal. Each bin value of the histogram corresponds to how many times the associated code of this bin is counted. The offset of the ADC can be estimated as the average code of all if the input signals applied have a zero mean. The offset error is thus, the difference between the average output code and the ideal output code. The gain error defined as the ratio of the actual transfer function slope over the ideal one can be seen on the histogram as a discrepancy between the first and the last bins weight and their ideal weight. For instance, a slope coefficient lower than the ideal one (negative gain error) will display an histogram close to the ideal one shrink into fewer bins and extreme bins values higher than expected as depicted by the \figurename~\ref{fig:gain-error-hist}.

\begin{figure}[htp]

    \caption{Gain error detection in an histogram based analysis}
    \label{fig:gain-error-hist}
\end{figure}

The input signal can be a ramp, a sine wave, or small signal variation around an even increasing offset, the DNL and INL can be extracted by subtracting the actual ADC histogram to the ideal ADC histogram. In a practical implementation, the input stimulus might not be perfectly linear and might degrade the DNL estimation. As a common practice, the stimulus linearity is 2 to 3 bits higher than the ADC under test. The INL is defined as the cumulative sum of the DNL\@. To limit the number of record a ramp is usually preferred and has been selected. In order to test extract the total transfer function of the SAR, a ramp shall be generated for each quadrant define by the two bits given as depicted by \figurename~\ref{fig:sar-test-input}.

    \caption{Input voltage profile and quadrant sent to the SAR under test}
    \label{fig:sar-test-input}
\end{figure}

The differential input voltage have been generated with an Hameg HMP4040 automated through the GPIB bus. About the digital signals sent, they are generated by a NI-USB 8452 and drive directly pads of the test chip. Inside it, those signals are reshaped with a Schmitt trigger inside the chip. The RESETN signal is asynchronous and reset all digital parts. Due to the different time to respond of each signal generator, the quadrant could be receive by the test chip far before or after the input voltage change. To prevent erroneous conversions, overlapping range large of 300 mV around the quadrant transitions allow a change within a range of sample will be removed to get the transfer function.
