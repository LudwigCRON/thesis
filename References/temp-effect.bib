@article{Allen1976,
abstract = {The adiabatic approximation and perturbation theory to second order in atomic displacement are used to construct a theory of thermal-electron energy shifts. Both intraband and interband 'self-energy' and 'Debye-Waller' corrections are included. A sum rule based on translational invariance clarified the intimate relation between these two types of correction. Various kinds of cancellation between the terms can be seen explicitly for the two limiting cases of a very narrow band and a small gap in a nearly-free-electron band structure.},

abstract = {This book discusses new techniques for detecting, controlling, and exploiting the impacts of temperature variations on nanoscale circuits and systems. A new sensor system is described that can determine the temperature dependence as well as the operating temperature to improve system reliability. A new method is presented to control a circuit's temperature dependence by individually tuning pull-up and pull-down networks to their temperature-insensitive operating points. This method extends the range of supply voltages that can be made temperature-insensitive, achieving insensitivity at nominal voltage for the first time.},
